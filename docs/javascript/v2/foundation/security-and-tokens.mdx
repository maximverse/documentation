## How can I get my account verified?
Our onboarding is automatic. Once signed up, the dashboard will present you further steps.
These usually include adding a payout method and more details about your business.

## What's pending balance?
These are payments that are being settled. It takes 4 days for a payment individually to be changed to **available balance**.

## How fast do I receive payouts?
If you have available balance and request a payout, it usually takes 12-16 hours to be sent to your attached payout method.

## Can I add another payout method?

If your desired payout method isn't available and you wish to receive funds in an alternative method, there usually is a minimum threshold of minimum payout request.
Email us at contact@cycopay.com for such an inquiry.

## How do you handle chargebacks?
We'll let you know if there is a chargeback and inform you with further steps.

## My country isn't available, what should I do?
Email us at contact@cycopay.com, we'll make sure you can onboard under exceptions.
